## Sprint 2 Review

### SRS Sections Updated

The SRS sections updated in Sprint 1 were our requirements page and the Software Architecture Diagram. 

### User Story

Our user stories that were updated in Sprint 1 were the live_translation, and the video_input user stories.

### Sprint Requirements Attempted

The team attempted to have the video displayed and have the transcripts and some sort of video player side by side on the home page and conducted research on the video player.

Req #1 "A method for users to insert a YouTube URL"
Req #2 "A method for users to view youtube transcripts"
Req #5  "A method for users to see the video on the screen"

### Completed Requirements

Req #1 "A method for users to insert a YouTube URL"
Req #2 "A method for users to view youtube transcripts"
Req #5  "A method for users to see the video on the screen"

### Incomplete Requirements

### The summary of the entire project

In summary, our project will contain a user login/registration system where a user will have an account where they can paste videos, fetch transcripts with translations to english, and be able to pick words users want to memorize and generate flashcards for people to memorize words that can be utilized in day to day life.

## Sprint 3 Planning

## Requirements Flex

5/5 requirement flexes remaining

## Technical Debt
N/A 

### Requirement Target
The goal for the next sprint is to update our video player with a better one and setup a way to let our translation api know which language to translate from and to.

Req #8 When user load videos, the translation should know the video language source and be able to translate to English without fail
Req #5 A method for users to see the video on the screen (Will improve)

### User Stories
The user stories we will be working on are video_input and live_translation.

### Planning
Our plan for this project is to get the video input and live translations fully functioning by having 2 meetings as a group to ensure we are on track and assigning components to every teammate.

### Action Items
Weekly meetings need to be longer than previous meetings to make sure everyone is on track.

### Issues and Risks
Being on spring break can reduce productivity and the generative AI API might take some more time to get lined up perfectly with the transcripts.

### Team Work Assignments
Tu: Improve the video player.
Varun: Research the translation and implement a language drop to feed into translation api.
Eric: Research how to highlight have word bank in the database.
