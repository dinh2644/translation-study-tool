## Sprint 4 Review

### SRS Sections Updated
The updated SRS sections was mainly the user_interface section.

### User Story
The main user stories that we worked on were live_translation and video input. 


### Sprint Requirements Attempted

Req #4 A method for users to create/login to their account (setup)
Req #6: Let user sees a translation below the original transcript
Req #9 User will be able to see a vocab bank that will hold any highlighted words in translation box they choose to save

### Completed Requirements

Req #4 A method for users to create/login to their account (setup)
Req #6: Let user sees a translation below the original transcript (translation api was improved to prevent gateway timeout)
Req #9 User will be able to see a vocab bank that will hold any highlighted words in translation box they choose to save

### Incomplete Requirements
N/A

### The summary of the entire project
In summary, we are developing an webpage that will allow users to paste in links to create accounts with our platform where users can paste in video links, get the video transcripts with english translations, and highlight specific words they would like to memorize and study for the future. 

## Sprint 5 Planning

## Requirements Flex

5/5 requirement flexes remaining

## Technical Debt
N/A

### Requirement Target

Req #4 "A method for users to create/login to their account" (Will improve by protecting routes)
Req #3 "A method to let users highlight words from the translation box of the loaded video"


### User Stories
flash_cards

### Planning
We will meet on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday with deadlines in place prior to the meeting to have parts of the tasks functioning so we can review one another's work and make improvements and bug fixes as needed. 
### Action Items
In order to complete this sprint we need to have the vocab box fully functioning with the ability to highlight words and for it to go into the box so we can easily start the flashcard implementation. 

### Issues and Risks
If we do not have the highlighting function working then it will delay our flashcard process and possibly not allow us to set up our flashcards page on time and have it fully functioning by the end of the semester.

### Team Work Assignments
Eric Chen: Finish the highlighting function + Start working on the flashcard page 
Varun Dileepan: Work on the Auth0 Implemenation (improve it)
Tu Dinh: Start researching the potential Language Learning Model for AI use (if feasible)
