### Requirement Target

Req #6: Let user sees a translation below the original transcript

### User Stories

live_translation
flash_cards


### Planning
The plan is that our team will meet on Wednesday after class, Friday evening, and Saturday evening in order to get our translation in line. We will work together and debug the code and make a plan of how to execute this component. 

### Action Items
In order to complete this sprint we need to have a finalized API for translation, write a class with methods to help execute the translations and combine line it up with the other components on the transcript to ensure maximum accruacy and consistency. 

### Issues and Risks
The risks that arise are accuracy of the translations and the ability of it lining up perfectly with the times like the original transcript. 

### Team Work Assignments
Eric Chen: Will implement vocab bank
Varun Dileepan: Research Auth0
Tu Dinh: Will optimize arml translation and/or resesarch other translation apis
