### Requirement Target

Req #7 "Let user make flash cards decks from work bank"
Req #10 "User will be able to see flashcards in each deck"

### User Stories

flash_cards

### Planning

We will communicate through Discord as usual and notify eachother of which files we will be working with. We will ask for help from eachother or
elsewhere in order to complete or setup the targeted requirement.

### Action Items

A successful merge of two branches where one deals with Authentication setup and the other with the highlighting implementation. A sideline testing
with Jest will be done on the side to ensure stability of components as we add more.

### Issues and Risks

Teammates having other assignments due or having to go back home for work related matters.

### Team Work Assignments

Eric Chen: Will implement making flashcard decks from vocab bank
Varun Dileepan: Will test other components
Tu Dinh: Will implement Jest/Unit/Functional testing for current/new components that will be added during this sprint
