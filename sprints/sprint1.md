## Sprint 1 Review

### SRS Sections Updated

The SRS sections that we updated as a team were the Team section where we included all of our roles and pre-project skills. We also added more details on the purpose of our project and listed definitions that are critical to our project.

### User Story

We updated the video_input user story file.

### Sprint Requirements Attempted

In sprint 0 we completed the introductions in the SRS document and specified what future requirements we will implement.

### Completed Requirements

The requirements we completed were to give users a means of inserting YouTube video's URL and a means of viewing the extracted transcript from the pasted YouTube video

### Incomplete Requirements

We were able to get all of our requirements done.

### The summary of the entire project

Our website allows users to have their own accounts and can paste the link to any YouTube video and get the transcript in the language of the video and the transcript will be translated into english. In addition, users will be able to select specific words and have specific words saved and be in the form of flashcards. Once in flashcards they will be linked to the user account the flashcards can be saved for future reference.

## Sprint 2 Planning

## Requirements Flex

5/5 requirement flexes remaining

## Technical Debt

No, we met all of our requirements from the previous sprint. 

### Requirement Target

The corresponding SRS requirement our team will complete next sprint will be the means of allowing users to view the video in a video player after inserting the YouTube video's URL. 

### User Stories

video_input and live_translation

### Planning

Our team will sit down and talk about what video player library out there will be best for user experience and how it will work together with the displayed transcript. Before coding the video player we need to carefully plan how this component will interact with other components in our project to make sure it syncs with the transcript and translations.

After that, we will make a separate component in our project folder that will represent the video player.

### Action Items

- Set a good time for everyone to meet and plan
- Finding a reliable and working video player implementation
- Have the video player and transcripts side by side (UI)

### Issues and Risks

- Potential conflict with mobile view with the video player
- No team members having time to meet or implement the requirements

  1. We will find and ensure the video player implementation will be compatible for mobile view in our planning stage
  2. Use a calendar meeting tool to see what time frame is good for all team members


### Team Work Assignments

Eric Chen: Will implement the video player.
Varun Dileepan: Will plan and research video player libraries or implementations methods.
Tu Dinh: Structure the project to ensure component is flexible and works with other components later on.
