### The summary of the entire project

LiveLingo, is a studying tool in the form of a web app for translating non-English videos that doesn't have reliable or no English transcripts or subtitles at all. It is an app that solves a problem where language is no longer a barrier to understanding and learning from online videos. LiveLingo provides the leisure to create flashcards for any video where our users can have their own video unique flashcard decks.
