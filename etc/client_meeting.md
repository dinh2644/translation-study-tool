## Client Meeting Notes

**Project Name:** [LiveLingo]
**Date:** [02/07/2025]
**Client Name:** [Varun Dileepand]
**Interviewed By:** [Tu Dinh]

### **Client Overview**
- **Brief description of the client and their background:**
  (Example: Kevin is a Dungeon Master who wants a tool to help manage his D&D campaigns.)

  Varun is an ambition college student and an english speaker who wants to learn a language as a hobby.

- **Client’s main goal for the software:**
  (Example: The tool should help track player turns, roll dice automatically, and send notifications.)

  A tool to provide a convenient platform for language learners to dissect foregin videos that have unreliable or no subtitles at all.
  Ideally I want the tool to support my language I want to learn. An ability to add flashcards or export them somewhere would be nice.

---

### **Interview Questions & Responses**

#### **1. What are the costs vs. budget?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "I don’t want to spend much, ideally free, but I’d consider paying a one-time fee.")

I am looking for a 100% free tool that offers at least a core feature for minimal to medium use.

**Clarification & Notes:**
(Example: The client is looking for a free tool but may accept optional paid features.)

I would consider paying for a one-time fee instead of a monthly subscription.


---

#### **2. What is the timeframe for this project?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "I need this ready before my next campaign starts in three months.")

I wouldn't say I need this as soon as possible but I do have a lot of videos I want to learn from which can help me a ton.

**Clarification & Notes:**
(Example: A strict deadline, must focus on core features first.)

A working core feature would supplement my needs so if I had to give a timeframe, I would say 1-3 months would be ideal.



---

#### **3. What problem are you trying to solve?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "Managing initiative order and tracking actions is too slow.")

I find amazing videos online but they would sometimes have no english translation at all or bad auto translation.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- The real problem is **speed and efficiency** during gameplay, not just "initiative tracking."
- Consider features like **automation** and **UI improvements** to streamline this.

  Even if there are reliable translations, having a platform to easily save certain words to an external place or on the site would feel complete.

---

#### **4. What is the most important feature?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "Initiative tracking needs to be easy and automatic.")

The ability for me to add a video file/url to the site and have the live translation for each timestamp.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- This feature should be the **core focus** of the software.
- Other features (e.g., dice rolling) are secondary.

The live dialogue translation is the most important. 
Then the ability to save words to a list or flashcard deck for that video would be beneficial everytime I want to revisit the site and review.

---

#### **5. Is there a similar product on the market?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "Yes, but they are either too complex or too expensive.")

Screenapp has a similiar feature as well as animelon. Screenapp however requires a subscription to use the core feature(s) and animelon has frequent crashes and is only for anime/japanese.
The two can also feel bloated with a lot of stuff on the site but that isn't much of a total nuisance. 

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Competitor analysis needed.
- Find a way to differentiate: **Simpler UI? Free version? Customizable?**

I need a free straightforward tool that has a good selection of language support, and most importatntly, my target language.
The UI should be easy to use with a simple goal in mind. 

---

#### **6. Are there any existing products or technologies that will need to be integrated?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "It would be nice if it worked with Roll20 or D&D Beyond.")

It would be nice if there is a chrome extension version where I can one click to the site instead of me having to manually paste in the video url or upload the video file.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Check for **APIs** for possible integrations.
- Consider a **manual import/export** feature if full integration isn’t feasible.

Video dialogue to text APIs is needed.

---

#### **7. What does success look like for this project?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "If my players can see whose turn it is without me saying anything, that’s a win.")

If my users can use the platform to study or use the live english translations to write down the foreign language version of it would be the ultimate goal.
The flashcard deck feature would definitely keep me on the site a lot longer too instead of closing it after I write down my sentences or words I need.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Focus on **visual clarity and notifications**.

A simple UI the user can easily open up to study like the Pomorodo timer is how I want the web app to feel.

---

#### **8. What risks are associated with a malicious user?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "Not much, unless players try to cheat dice rolls.")

Somehow bypass by uploading an extremely large video or large flashcard decks

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Consider **server-side dice validation** to prevent cheating.

We need an input check to validate the file size of uploadeds videos.

---

#### **9. What is the expected lifetime of this software?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "I want to use it for many campaigns, so it should last for years.")

My use of this software should last forever unless I reach fluency from learning the language.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Future **maintenance and updates** should be considered.

File size or length of video can maybe crash API requests or large flashcard decks can crash server.

---

#### **10. What additional features would you like?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "A way to send private messages to players would be cool.")

Maybe a feature that allows me to export my saved words or flashcards to a flashcard tool like Anki would be nice

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Nice-to-have, but **not essential** for version 1.

Being able to highlight a word and save that word to my saved list or flashcards.

---

## **Key Takeaways & Next Steps**
- **Most important feature:** Embedded video gets a live translation based on timestamp.
- **Secondary features:** Save foreign words to a vocabulary list and flashcard deck
- **Deadline:** 3 months
- **Risks:** Server or APIs crashing due to large video file size or duration. 

### **Next Steps:**
✅ Prioritize initiative tracking
✅ Research existing products for inspiration
✅ Explore integration options with Roll20/D&D Beyond
