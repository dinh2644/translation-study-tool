## **Persona**
- **Name:** [AJ CJ]
- **Relevant Characteristics:** [Watches content videos in foreign languages as an English speaker over the years, and understands some phrases but struggles to learn effectively due to a lack of knowledge in that language. Translating the words every single time is simple, but very time-consuming and demotivates learning.]
- **Behaviors & Attitudes:** [Prefers to have live translations while watching videos, on the same screen as the videos so any key phrases can be highlighted and translated on the spot.]
- **Goal:** [AJ CJ's goal is to improve their language skills through watching videos in the preferred language through live translation into English, selecting key words/phrases in a separate transcript on the side, and being able to practice key words/phrases collected from the transcript to reinforce learning.]
