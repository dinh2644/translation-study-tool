                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    LiveLingo is a translation tool designed to help you understand YouTube videos that have may have non-English transcripts but no English subtitles.
                </p>
                <p className="text-md text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    In version 1, LiveLingo works exclusively with YouTube videos by pulling available transcripts and translating them into English â€” giving you access to global content that would otherwise be hard to follow.
                </p>
                <p className="text-md text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    As the app evolves, LiveLingo will support more media types beyond YouTube. We&apos;re working toward features like AI-powered speech-to-text, allowing us to generate transcripts even when none exist, and deliver smarter, context-aware translations.
                </p>
                <p className="text-md text-gray-500 mt-6 italic">
                    This is just the beginning â€” we&apos;re building an app where language is no longer a barrier to understanding online videos.
